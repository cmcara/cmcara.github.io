## About Me ##
Hello! My name is Charlie, and I am currently a student in the Earth Data Analytics certificate program through CU Boulder's [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/) and [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/). I am originally from Virginia and studied economics and math at UVA before moving to Nashville to begin a career in the live music industry. I worked for talent agents, promoters, managers, and accountants hoping to combine my love of numbers and live music without finding the right fit, but I continued to develop an affinity and enjoyment for the logical problem solving of analytics.  
  
Looking outside of entertainment for the first time, I initially explored more traditional routes of operations or policy data analytics and MBA programs before stumbling upon earth science applications through *The Lost City of the Monkey God* by Douglas Preston. I recommend the entire book, but the author's off-handed reference to researchers "beating up on the data" from a laser flown over a jungle to generate a surface map showing "lost" cities below the canopy cover had me hooked. The more I looked into visualizations and modeling, the more math I found and interested I became. CU Boulder and The EDA program are a perfect place to formalize and improve my coding abilities in an open-source earth science environment, and I look forward to documenting my progress here and taking these skills into the Applied Math Master's program I plan to begin at Boulder in January 2026.
