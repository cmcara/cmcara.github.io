Using daily data pulled from NOA and resampled on an annual basis, I ran an OLS regression on temperature data in Charlottesville dating back to 1893. I found a minor positive correlation showing an increase of 0.00033993 degrees/year. This value lags behind most estimates of average annual temperature increase by multiple orders of magnitude ([Link](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature)), but the more surprising result of this exercise was the variability I encountered when implementing different cut-offs for which years to include in the data. Given that some years in the data do not have a complete record for each day in that year, there is some bias in resampling each year by a mean value and considering all years' means equallly, but when I implemented different cutoffs to refine my results, I started seeing negative values contrary to expectations.

## About Me ##
Hello! My name is Charlie, and I am currently a student in the Earth Data Analytics certificate program through CU Boulder's [Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu/) and [ESIIL](https://esiil.org/). I am originally from Virginia and studied economics and math at the University of Virginia before moving to Nashville to begin a career in the live music industry. continuing to develop an affinity and enjoyment for the logical problem solving of analytics while I worked for talent agents, promoters, managers, and accountants without finding the right fit. 
  
Looking outside of entertainment for the first time, I initially explored more traditional routes in operations or policy analytics and MBA programs before stumbling upon earth science applications through *The Lost City of the Monkey God* by Douglas Preston. The entire story is fascinating, but the author's off-handed reference to researchers "beating up on the data" taken from LiDAR flown over the jungle in order to generate a surface map showing ruins below the canopy had me hooked. The more I looked into visualizations and modeling in earth science, the more math I found and interested I became. I am fortunate to have spent a large portion of my life outdoors, and CU Boulder and The EDA program are the perfect places to formalize and improve my  abilities to contributed in an open-source earth science environment.
